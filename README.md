# Ultimate-Hangman-Game

Ultimate Hangman is a game in which the User has to Guess a word which is represented by a row of Asterisk(‘*’), representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player(computer) draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.
The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. On the other hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to hang the man (traditionally the head, then the torso, then the arms and legs one by one), the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the man is completed.
